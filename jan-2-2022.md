# Hackers, Objects, and Nothingness

# Preface

Opinions expressed in this writing are my own, though there’s not really such thing as one’s own thoughts anyway. I hate being interrupted while writing so there will probably be inaccuracies in definitions and repetitions of pre-existing, well-defined concepts (due to restricting myself to not using the internet while writing). However, accuracy isn’t the goal of these writings. The goal is not necessarily to discover and academicize and atomize and pin down, in some formalistic and rigorous way, phenomena and concepts which I’m sure many educated and intelligent people have already done to their death. The goal of these writings is to *muse. Muse* in the way that I see fit. **It is a luxury that I have not often allowed myself, and am attempting to see where it goes. I hope there are some of you who find these musings enjoyable. I hope there are some of you who disagree with me, who want to have a dialogue.** DMs are open. Though I am also trying to take more time to myself these days, so apologies if I don’t respond promptly.

# Foreward

Now Listening: System 7 - Alphawave EP

Good morning. It is the second day of the New Year. Writing this on the second day of the new year, as opposed to the first, is an expression of my process. Procrastination. Sometimes it is unrecognized as an expression of process: The unconscious, background dissection of a cloud of ideas. These usually manifest in immaterialities, like dreams and wispy conceptual thoughts which I solidify later. In this case, twenty four hours later. I woke up this morning after experiencing deep pains in my lower back over the span of two days. An unfortunate blight, but an expected one. Neglect of my corporeal structure has become an unshakeable habit developed over the course of many, many years. It is getting better, though.

As a software engineer, it has often perplexed me why the job is sometimes disastrously droll. I suspect some of it is because when one majors in Computer Science, and then moves to become a Software Engineer, there is an unspoken disconnect between the intriguing aspects of computers and computation, and the application of those concepts in the current episteme. I also suspect that because I personally actually prefer the realm of philosophy and abstractions as a point of intrigue, and that I saw, in some ways, the depth of abstraction and intrigue in the field of Computer Science but did not act on discovering and exploring said intrigue. This stops in 2022.

# The Computer Science Major

I can only speak for myself, though I hope there are those that agree with me. The construction of the computer science major in the majority of university programs is, procedurally, an divinely ironic exercise in neglect. One takes their first class in Java (nowadays probaby python) in order to learn the mechanics, the syntax, and the experience of programming. We download eclipse, an integrated development environment, and start printing statements and running functions as a way to introduce our fingers and minds to the act. After some time, this performance becomes more integrated. We then learn the fundamentals of important concepts of networking, we learn data structures, memory management, and eventually trail off into specialization which often times has no bearing on what our careers pan out to be. Along the way we may fraternize with combinatorics, computational mathematics, statistics - ultimately supplementary disciplines (which many struggle with on account of them not actually being "relevant") that still left me with an emptiness of understanding that was hard to describe at the time (I was a terrible college student).

What a completely and utterly unsatisfactory process. It was only three years after graduation did I discover that there were people in the past who studied Logic itself (the boolean variable, which represents true/false, is appropriately named after one of these people), and that there were people before those past people who were concerned with applications of Philosophy. This can be traced back to the heralds of Western thought - I’m talking Aristotle, the Stoics, etc (I have no information currently as to how this developed in the East or whether or not there was cross chatter). Luckily for me, the college I went to shoved contemporary western philosophy down our throats as required courses. They were, next to the religion classes I took as part of the core curriculum, some of the most enjoyable and eye opening experiences I had. And I *barely even did the readings.* As someone who constantly debated whether or not they should switch to the Philosophy major, but was constantly told that there was “no money in that field - it is too academic and depressing,” I felt very deeply towards, but was unable to articulate, what was missing from my computer science studies. Logic is seen as this implicit, common-sense *thing* that we constantly apply and assume works in a certain, predictable way without ever touching its inherent complications with a ten-foot pole. I have yet to meet anyone in the Software Engineering field who has a vested interest in, or has even forayed into the academic array of Logic or Philosophy. Anyone can tell you, however, that Software Engineers have a lot of hot-takes and enjoy a good debate about something or another. This is probably a quality that keeps me hooked to some degree - the people around me have a somewhat unspoken mental preoccupation with making observations and understanding the nature of problems.  

# Hacking

Now that the personal reflection salad is over, let’s get to the meat. Recently I have been thinking about the relationship between Computer Science, the field of study and the people in it, and the idea of hacking. What on earth *is* hacking, fundamentally? I was sitting on the toilet this morning, as many of us do, looking at a fixture in the corner of our recently re-decorated bathroom. It was a wine glass which contained some dried flowers. The original poop-thought was something along the lines of “what is it that creative people do and why are they always so similar to each other in the way they process things,” coming from the perspective of a person who struggles daily to call themselves “a creative.” I thought about my profession, about computers, about my failed experiments in replicating a piece of hardware that brought me much joy as a child (Vintage 90s Christmas lights which played music, of which the sound quality had a particular analog distortion which gave it an important character, only replicable by emulating the built-in-hardware by applying certain sound design transforms on a digital sound which I never ended up creating because I had to run around my neighborhood preparing for a christmas party), and about a paper I read many years ago about software vulnerabilities, most likely informed by the recent, hilarious vulnerability affecting the software world right now in the `log4j` library. 

I had a thought: How would one hack a glass wine bottle? The irony is that the answer was right in front of me. The wine bottle that my roommate had placed the flowers contained the answer. Let me explain what thoughts occurred to me between writing this and a quick smoke break, focusing specifically on the **bottle** as the object.

## The construction and deconstruction of an object

What is a bottle? To be able to say what a bottle is, we have to be able to say what any material object is. An `object` is an aggregation of `elements` that undergoes a process of, what I will call `solidification`. `Solidification` is an immaterial process by which requisite `elements` combine and no longer require discrete observation. Let’s draw that out (with text)
.
A human being is looking at the object. We first see

- Glass, in some short of shape

Ok, so a bottle is shaped glass. And we’re done, right? Obviously not. There are other compositional elements which are of importance that we need to pin down. 

- The glass must be a specific shape: it must have a hole in it

Ok, but if I get a sheet of glass and poke a hole in it, I don’t have a bottle.

- The glass must have a hole and the hole must be at the top

So, a glass tupperware container?

- The glass must be able to be held in the human hand

Ah, so a glass shuriken

- The hole cannot persist through the entirety of the 2D plane on which it rests

...and so on and so on. This discussion of requirements continues to infinity and its propulsion is fueled by something which we will get to later. Great, we’ve rediscovered the debate around Platonic forms. Something about “bottle-ness,” and whatnot. My ex girlfriend one time drank coffee out of a cereal bowl and a tiny something in me broke. We were really stoned, though. 

From the software engineering perspective, if we wanted to materialize a glass wine bottle, we would first need a list of requirements, similar to the above, and then attempt to create it from the ground up, patching up vulnerabilities along the way. This process is called development, which is the vehicle of `solidification`. At some point, once the entire bottle is “solid,” we hope to god that the vulnerabilities are patched up enough that no one can de-solidify/`deconstruct` the thing. We task thousands of people to hold it and do crazy things with it to assure us that the construction process went well. And then, after releasing the glass wine bottle to the world, convinced of its solidness, an opera singer hits a high note and the whole object shatters and shards of glass fly everywhere and someone’s throat gets slashed.

Back to the drawing board? Not exactly. This is *exactly the compromise* of the process. `solidification` is an imperfect process (perfection does not exist, go to therapy for more information on that) in which *elements* are “stuck together” in a some kind of way. And there is a vulnerability in the `solidification` process itself.

Well, what are the `elements`? We have glass, to start. If we want to understand why our bottle failed and killed someone, however, we would be completely unable to do so if we simply said “it is a glass thing with a hole in it." We could always try to create a glass out of metal, though now I’m really curious if, when attending an opera concert, whether or not the liquid-holding-containers present specifically cannot be made of glass due to safety concerns. However, if we were to choose metal as an `element`, some Marvel hero with super strength shows up in UAT and tries to drink from it, accidentally crushing it, spilling wine all over their freshly cleaned pyrex super suit. Glass is comprised up off protons and electrons when you really get down to the nitty gritty of it, and maybe if we worked on that plane we could solve the issue. Just arrange the electrons and protons in a way that can’t be destroyed lol. Ah, easy. Let’s send that request to CERN and all of a sudden we have a perfect bottle that causes DNA denaturation and turns us all into primordial soup. 

Jokes aside, the somewhat meta aspect of this form of joking around is that software engineers do it with each other on the job *all the fucking time.* This way of analyzing objects reveals some important fundamental understandings of how I believe the world works, which I will list up below.

1. The creation of an object is bound to some requirements
2. An object is comprised of `elements` which have been `solidified` in some way
3. `Solidification` is an imperfect process which creates `vulnerabilities`
4. `Vulnerabilities` are the roots of `deconstruction` and the points at which any object can be destroyed

Now, where does *hacking* lodge itself? Well, a hack is sort of the space between the rules, but not exactly. It is the exploitation of relationships and bonds. All relationships in this world, all processes of binding and being “stuck together,” in the `solidification` process, whether they are material or immaterial, are imperfect in their construction, and as such, hacking is a function which applies pressure to this imperfection, resulting in the potential destruction of the solid object by weakening the relationships that shape it. 

Ok, so how is sticking dried flowers in a wine bottle a form of *hacking* though? Let’s get to the next topic. 

## Hacking Abstraction

The stakeholders want a glass bottle. Our designer designs it. We construct it, gathering the required materials and sticking them together. Simple. But here’s the rub: “Why do our stakeholders want a glass bottle?” Every engineer who has asked this question and been told to shut up, else they be promoted to manager or product owner or creative director or something. Nobody wants that kind of responsibility. Me likey press keyboard button. 

Aside: To any engineers reading this. Please keep asking that question. It may not say it in the contract, but asking that question *is our job. Asking that question is our role, our destiny.* 

The stakeholders will give some reason. They’ll always give some reason. The client wants to drink wine, and they want it to look nice. Discussion ensues. Ok, they want to drink wine and they want it to look elegant. More discussion. “Look elegant” turns into “feel good” which turns eventually into “be able to be held in their human hands without fear or anxiety of spillage, be able to pour into other containers without fear of anxiety of spillage...” etcetera, etcetera.  

What have we just stumbled upon? Simply better defined requirements? I think something a bit deeper. Well, let’s say that this product, a glass bottle, doesn’t actually exist in the world (until after these next couple sprints). This material object is borne of desire, or need, or something. It has some raison d’etre, though we don’t necessarily need to know what that is right now - only that there is one. Formally, this is called the *cause*, but since that word is a bit too abstract, and its existence is ironically the effect of imperfection being hard-coded into Reality, we’ll just call the encapsulation of “why do our stakeholders want a glass bottle,” the `impetus`. The `impetus` is the driving force which creates and refines the `requirements`.  Without an impetus, there are no requirements, no material object to be constructed or destroyed - there would be absolutely `nothing` (more on that later lol).

How is `impetus` related to hacking? The world is a series of functions acting on inputs and producing outputs. Because we don’t have the requisite intelligence right now to completely deconstruct every aspect of the world, we compromise by solidifying certain unknown elements into knowable ones. Electrons may be divisible, I don’t know. What I do know is that we need a starting point. This need for a starting point, ironically, is an `impetus` which results in this thing we call `language` , but I digress. Let’s just get to the definition so we can discuss it.

A `hack` is a function applied on the object created of `requirements` stemming from the `impetus` that ignores the `impetus` (?)

Close, but not quite. A hack isn’t always a function of the object itself, but most often its requisite elements. 

A `hack` is the deconstruction of the object itself, resultant from the `impetus` 

Maybe a bit closer? Though the object may stay intact after the hack, so...

A `hack`  is a function applied on the deconstructed elements borne of the specific `solidified` `elements` of an object (ones that were only necessarily `solidified` in accordance to the `impetus`

Not quite this either. 

But something like this. I’m not good at creating definitions, but I really enjoy trying. A definition must be succinct in order to be good. Those are my requirements. In order to achieve that, we need to keep refining. 

In order to refine, let’s go deeper. What is the `impetus` of a `hack` , provided that a `hack` is some kind of immaterial object? I would posit that a hack has no impetus. A hack is simply the force of deconstruction at work. The dialectical contradiction at play. The destruction of any object is contained within its construction. `Hacking` is a function applied on those points of destruction, regardless of purpose / `impetus`

Aside: I skipped over the part where `function` == `object` on some fundamental level but we can’t go there right now. Computer Scientists know this fundamentally without really thinking about it since whenever we need to do code abstraction or refactoring we figure out just how easy this equality can be implemented. 

So when I put dried flowers in a glass bottle, we have to make some concessions, the primary of which is that the `impetus` for a glass bottle is that we needed something to hold liquids. But what is to be done when there are no liquids in the glass bottle? Fill it up again with more liquids? This is a design flaw. If I were to make a near-perfect glass bottle, it would automatically fill up with whatever liquids needing holding at any given point, automatically, never to be empty. The fact that a glass bottle can be empty given the `impetus` we described above is precisely its vulnerability. I have applied a function on this vulnerability, and now this glass bottle has been hacked. 

What do we usually do when glass bottles become empty? We *throw them away.* We send them to be *deconstructed.* I think about this and my mind goes crazy. It is so simple, so cool, so abstract. Human behavior obeys abstractions at every given turn, but these abstractions feel like they exist. Sometimes I genuinely wonder if I’m seeing what Plato and the other proto-computer scientists saw.  

One this vulnerability is known, a glass bottle can be used for so many things. I’ve seen people smash it over others’ heads. It can be a weapon - even a musical instrument. But yeah, imagine a youtube video where someone has “GLASS BOTTLES: HACKED” as their thumbnail. Sounds ridiculous to some, but I’d genuinely watch it. 

Just to put this paragraph here, since I’m getting a bit tired, we now know to some degree what it takes to be a hacker. It is no different than the current de-facto definition. You apply functions on vulnerabilities. You obviously need to know where these vulnerabilities are, but now, thinking about it abstractly, we know precisely where to look: At the points of construction. If you want to be a hacker, speaking as a non-hacker (so hackers, please correct me if I’m wrong) my guess is that research into how something was created is the fastest way to figure out how to destroy it. This applies to material objects, immaterial objects, systems (Hello, political agitators), everything, I believe. 

What’s the point of being a hacker though? Is it just for fun? Or is it necessary?

# Nothingness, the Void, etc.

“Without an impetus, there are no requirements, no material object to be constructed or destroyed. There would be absolutely `nothing`  “ - Me, a couple of paragraphs ago.

Ah, yes. Let’s briefly muse on nothingness. On Ein Sof, on the creator of God, on the being which hides itself at every moment and obfuscates the full scale of its power as part of its `impetus`. But let’s muse on it using simple examples that can be scaled up. 

We were talking about construction and deconstruction, with `impetus` and `elements` . What happens when you chance upon an empty field and say “There’s nothing here. I want to build a house,” and chop down some wood and start placing logs and carving notches into them. At what point do you have a house? At what point do you recognize that the wood you chopped is no longer `nothing`? When the last log is placed on the roof? The rub is that the situation in the ship of Theseus analogy works in both time directions. `Nothing` is always present, regardless of whether or not you place objects in what you perceive to be its expanse. That is its function.

I think we, as humans, need to start taking `nothing` more seriously. Stop using the word without recognizing it’s power. `Nothing's`  wrong as a response to people asking whether something is troubling you. Well, when is `nothing` right? That would imply there indeed was a problem. But, the irony is that in order for you to describe that everything is going right in your life, you must take the object of `nothing` and categorically say that it is `wrong`. So *something* is wrong, and that thing is `nothing`.

Aside: I am not religious but I love studying religion. There are serious, *serious* theological implications to these statements that I won’t bother touching on here but am always free to discuss. 

`Nothing` is the first paradox, the thing which does not exist by definition and yet is able to be pointed to at every given moment. I subscribe to *creation ex nihilo,* which is the idea that matter is not eternal but must be created by some act. I subscribe to this idea so strongly and so precisely that I dissect every word in that sentence constantly, in the background of my mind, trying to find holes in it.

Aside: I have started to understand the implications of such a subscription. Talk to me about it in my DMs. 

So the empty field is `Nothing` and yet on closer observation you can see grass, air, oxygen, free radicals, clouds, *you.* There is clearly *something* there. And yet, there is `nothing`. There is a plane on which something can be constructed. The cool part about `nothing` is that because it is always present, construction is always possible. This is why the world will never be doomed. As long as `nothing` exists, then we have `nothing` to worry about. Does `nothing` only exist in the mind? Can it even be observed? Can it be *hacked?* Well, look around you. `Nothing` has a single flaw that is hacked every single day at every single moment in time. 

A part of me wants to keep this particular paragraph obfuscated and intentionally abstract and not systematic or logical on purpose. And so I will give into that part, and let you all think about it.
